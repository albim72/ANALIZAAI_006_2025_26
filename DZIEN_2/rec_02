Blade Runner 2049 dazzles with its visual mastery and hypnotic world-building. Director Denis Villeneuve expands the original’s themes with sensitivity, adding fresh philosophical depth. Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch’s score weaves an unsettling, futuristic atmosphere that grips you from the opening frame. It is both a respectful homage to the classic and a standalone work that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll.

Negative review
Tom Hooper’s Cats is a stark lesson in how not to adapt a beloved stage musical. The CGI looks unfinished, and the human-feline hybrids evoke discomfort rather than wonder. A chaotic narrative strips the story of cohesion, making it hard to invest emotionally in the characters’ fates. Instead of a magical spectacle, we get a curious misfire that quickly bores and leaves the viewer feeling they’ve wasted their time.
